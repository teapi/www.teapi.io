<h1>Databases</h1>
<p>Your database's configuration can be accessed via the <em>settings</em> section of the <a href="https://manage.teapi.io/">management console</a>. Your database's name is only to help you keep things organized.</p>

<p>You can choose to enable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">CORS</a> access to your database. By default, both are disabled.</p>

<p>If you intend to consume the API on a website using client-side code (JavaScript), you'll need to enable one or the other (or both). JavaScript frameworks, such as JQuery, support both. We suggest CORS, as it's specifically designed for this use-case and provides greater flexibility.</p>

<p>The most open setting is to enable JSONP and to enter 1 CORS origin with the value of <code>*</code>.</p>

<h2>keys</h2>
<p>Keys help control who can access your data and are used for grouping some of the usage reports. Typically, you'll want to create a key per client application. In other words, you'll want one for your iOS app, one for your Android app and one for your web app.</p>

<p>You control whether or not a key has write access, as well as whether or not requests using a key must be signed with a secret. A key that has write access must have a secret, but it's up to you whether requests made with read-only keys must be signed.</p>

<div class=important>
  <a name=secret></a>
  <p><strong>Which type of key should you choose?</strong><p>
  <p>While secrets are never transmitted, it isn't hard for a programmer to disassemble your application and extract the secret.</p>
  <p>For websites, signed keys are far more trouble than they are worth. For applications, signed keys provide a little more protection and are easy to implement, so there's little reason not to use them (even though the level of security they provide is dubious).</p>
</div>

<p>The above notice is true only for the case where your keys are distributed (such as when you're shipping a mobile application). If writes are only coming from your own servers, then the secrets associated with write-enabled keys are secure and the your writes are protected (which is why secrets with write-keys are required).</p>

<p>The <a href="/docs/readapi">Read API chapter</a> covers the implementation detail of both approaches.</p>

<p>The <a href=/docs/sync>synching chapter</a> goes into details about the sync process. From the <code>settings</code> section of the management console you'll get the information needed to configure your our sync libraries (host, key and secret) as well as the ability generate a new keys.</p>
