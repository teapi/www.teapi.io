<h1>Types</h1>
<p>Types represent a distinct entity within your system. Loosely speaking, a type is much like a database table. An important difference though, is that a type is meant to be denormalized and view-driven. For example, you might model <code>articles</code> and <code>tags</code> as two separate tables, but you'd have a single type, <code>articles</code>, which had an embedded array of <code>tags</code>.</p>

<p>The denormalized nature of a type cannot be overstated. In our experience, it is much better to have rich (even fat) web service responses versus forcing clients to make multiple calls and piecing data together. For one thing, a single API call, even if verbose, will almost always outperform multiple calls (often by a large margin). For another, when every client has to do the same work (requesting and merging multiple calls), you're duplicating logic better centralized.</p>

<p>The name you give a type is important. It's the name used in the Read API to access query this particular type. For example, a type called <code>books</code> would be accessible at https://ZYX.teapi.io/v1/<strong>books</strong>?key=XYZ.</p>

<p>Here's a sample book document that we'll use to explain types in greater detail:</p>

<pre data-language=json>
{
  "id": 4492938,
  "name": "Dune",
  "description": "......",
  "published": {
    "date": 1965,
    "publisher": "Chilton Books"
  },
  "type": "science-fiction",
  "author:" {
    "name": "Frank Herbert",
    "id": "herbertf",
    "url": "https://XXX.teapi.io/v1/authors/herbertf"
  },
  "tags": ["space", "opera", "hugo"]
}
</pre>

<p>While you can use whatever valid JSON structure you want, you do need to configure the primary key, any indexes you'll use for filtering, and optionally, parent relationships.</p>

<h2>Primary Key</h2>
<p>Every document must have a primary key which must be unique within its type. The primary key can be an integer (int), a string (text) or case-insensitive string (itext). For the above book document, the primary key field would be <code>id</code> and the type would be <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>The id field should likely map directly to your own internal ID (whether that's an auto-incrementing ID or a GUID, it doesn't matter). Every document will be directly accessible using this id. Here's a real example: <a href="https://sandbox.teapi.io/v1/companies/sendgrid?key=4800mh74u41s">https://sandbox.teapi.io/v1/companies/sendgrid?key=4800mh74u41s</a> (in this case, the id is <code>sendgrid</code>).</p>

<a name=indexes></a>
<h2>Indexes</h2>
<p>Indexes define how you'll query and sort documents. The index field is the path to the value within the document. For example, we'd likely want to be able to filter and sort by date, so we'd add an index on <code>published.date</code> of type <code>int</code>. With this index, we could sort by date using <code>sort=published.date</code>, which is a bit of a mouthful. To solve this, we can give the index an alias, <code>date</code>. In other words, the index field is the real path in the document, while the optional alias is the name to use in the Read API.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the <code>text</code> and <code>itext</code> types don't do full text searching. They are meant for short values, such as <code>category</code> or <code>status</code>. Values longer than 100 characters won't be indexed. Special full-text searching indexes are available and explained shorlty.</p>

<p>An index can also be created on an array (an array of integers, floats, booleans, strings or dates). Array indexes can only be used to check if a value exists within the array, such as finding documents that have a "scifi" tag. They are limited in terms of size and cannot be used for sorting (which probably makes sense anyways).</p>

<p>Integer, floats and dates indexes support range filters: >, >=, &lt; and &lt;= as well as equals and not equals. Text, itext and bool values only support equals and not equals.</p>

<p>It's possible to flag an index as being a <em>lookup</em>. Lookup indexes are meant mostly meant for string values such as <code>gender</code>, <code>status</code> or <code>haircolor</code> - indexes that have few distinct values compared to the total number of documents. When used appropriately (on values with low cardinality) they perform better and take up less space than normal indexes. Technically, you can create a lookup index on integers and floats, but this removes the ability to sort as well as using a range filter or not equal filter.</p>

<h2>Full Text Search</h2>
<p>You can create full text search indexes on the value of a specific field. If you want to index multiple fields, or want to associate keywords with a document, consider using a single field placed within the <a href=/docs/#meta>meta document</a>.</p>

<p>When you create a full text search index, you must specify the language of the content. Optionally specify a boosting field, which alters the ordering of documents returned when sorted by their full text search rank. A value less than 1 will reduce the document's rank, a value greater than 1 will increase it (it's a multiplicative factor).</p>

<p>Here's a sample of what a meta <code>search</code> field might look like:</p>
<pre data-language=json>
{
  "search": {
    "en": "....",
    "fr": "....",
    "boost": 5
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This document gets a boost, maybe based on the author's ranking.</p>

<a name=relationships></a>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Relationships are an optional and more complicated part of types. Relationships are created on the child type, and thus express the "belongs to" side of the relationship. To create a relationship, you need at least two types.</p>

<p>A relationship implicitly creates special indexes which automatically creates an intuitive URL structure. For example, if we were to define a relationship from <code>books</code> to <code>authors</code> on the <code>author.id</code> field, we'd be able to get a list of books written by Frank Herbert via: https://ZYX.teapi.io/v1/authors/herbertf/books?key=XYZ (as well as apply any additional book filters to retrieve a subset).</p>

<p>It's possible to create more than one relationship. A <code>book</code> coulds belong to an <code>author</code> as well as a <code>publisher</code>.</p>

<p>Remember, your types aren't set in stone. That said, changes made to types with hundreds of thousands of documents can take a while to propagate (the old structure remains active until the new one is ready). The best thing to do is to create a type with an name and primary key, upload a small sample of documents (~20) and play with various indexes and relationships.</p>
