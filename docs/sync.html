<h1>Sychronizing Data</h1>
<p>Changes made to data within your system must be synchronized to Teapi. There are a handful of ways to achieve this, but they all rely on using Teapi's Sync API through <a href="https://github.com/teapi">one of our libraries</a>. The API and libraries are small and simple, allowing you to create, update or delete documents individually or in bulk.</p>

<p>All of our libraries must first be configured using the Sync API settings found in the management console. For a Ruby example, after installing the teapi gem, you'd do:</p>

<pre data-language=ruby>
Teapi.configure do |config|
  config.host =  'HOST'
  config.sync_key = 'KEY'
  config.sync_secret = 'SECRET'
end
</pre>

<p>Once configured, documents can be synched. Each library's README explains how to use the specific library, but they're all quite similar. For example, to create a new document, you'd do: </p>

<pre data-language=javascript>
# ruby
Teapi::Documents.create('people', {id: 4, name: 'leto atreides', power: 9001})

// node
teapi.documents.create('people', {id: 4, name: 'leto atreides', power: 9001})

// go
t.Documents.Create("people", teapi.Doc(user))
</pre>

<a name=bulk></a>
<h2>Bulk Updates</h2>
<p>While sending updates a document at a time is fine, each library also exposes a bulk update method. Up to 1000 documents can be created/insertd at a time, along with up to 1000 deletions. Bulk updates perform much better and should be used whenever possible.</p>
